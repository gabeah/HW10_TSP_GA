Chromosome: For chromosome, we started off by making sure the is_valed returns an actual order list so that the chromosme's could be innitialized within the whole process. The fitness is found by taking a large number(one million in this case) and dividing it by the total distance of the ordered cities to get the chromosome's fitness level. Nothing had to be changed about chromosome's constructor and deconstuctor. mutate() is abel to mutate by taking a random part of the two chromosmes and switching it given by the two chromosmes switching the city with each other. Recombine combines two city pointers a and b by checking which of the two are bigger, which ever one is bigger ends up as the beginning city, and the other as the end. It then uses the built in crossover child function by initalizing two new children with the parents, then returning those children as a pair. In order to check if the value it's combining is even in the chromosme, it uses the is_in_range() function, which checks if the currently checked value is anywhere in the chromosome, returning a true or fale depending on if it's there or not. In order to generate random nummbers for the various instances of end, we built a random helper function that generates a number by checking within the range of the stated minimum and the stated max, having the range check from the min to the max.
Deme: For Deme's constuctor and deconstructor, we built ad loop in both that inserts a chromosome in the population, and deletes it from the deconstructor when done with it. We also added a loop that gets the toal fitness of all the chromosmes and a loop that determines the probabillity of each chromosome. Both of those are used for select_parent(). We also intialized mutate_rate outside of {} to be a true class parameter that will be used later. With get_best(), we are able to achieve a selctor that allows to return the highest fitness level in the list, that is then used to compare chromosomes for  For select_parent(), we use the same random number generator as the one used in the chromosome class to generate the random intervals that will be compared to the generated chromosomes. We then essentially match the fitness to the probaillity, which allows us to select a random parent, biasdly. To create the next generation of chromosomes, we select two random random parents and then mutate them based on the given mutation rate. We then create the new children by recombining the two parents, being pushed back as either the first or second child. After the intial loop, we delete the current parents through a for loop and end the program by adding the new created children to the population.
